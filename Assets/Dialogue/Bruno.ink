Hi Charlie! Ah, thanks, I've been waiting for this! I asked Kai if he could send me his recipe for his Fish n' Chips. The last time I visited him, he cooked for me, and I just couldn’t get the taste out of my head...
Aha... mmm... so this is how he does it! That's amazing, my stomach is already grumbling just reading this. Can you thank the old seabird for me?
Ah! Before I forget, could you give this letter to Daisy? I miss her, haven't seen her in ages! She was wondering if I could recommend a book to her. You know I have a passion for collecting and reading all kinds of books!
What genre do you think she would like? 
Heh, that's a good one! I already have one in mind. Thanks again, Charlie! And please thank Kai for the recipe. I’ll start cooking as soon as I'm done here!
