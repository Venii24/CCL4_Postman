Ahoy, Charlie! Thanks for visiting lil' ol' me. Did you give my letter to Bruno? What did he say?
Aye, that makes me glad!
Mmm? What’s this? A letter from Daisy?... ... Aye, that’s so sweet of the lady. Rosemary is my favorite herb! She knows me so well! Thanks, Charlie, for bringing me this. You are the best!
Well, if you'll excuse me, I can’t wait to brew this wonderful tea! Have a nice evening and see you tomorrow!
